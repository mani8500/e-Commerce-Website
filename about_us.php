		       <h2>Project Description and why I choose this project</h2>
		       <p> E-commerce websites are a huge market nowadays. I was always fascinated by how these websites are designed and developed, how they attract the audience and provide a smooth experience. So, I decided to develop the site myself. I have learned some of the coolest tricks that the web designers use and how simple factors like color, font, tag-lines play a huge role in attracting the customer to make a purchase. The user experience is the other side of the coin, in order to bring back the customers to revisit the site from time to time. After gaining an ample amount of knowledge from developing this website, I felt the project I have chosen was worth the shot. 
<br>
<br>
My project Web Programming E-commerce is a web application under the e-commerce domain. Users can shop products like Cameras, Watches, clothes through this online portal. Users can add products to their cart while browsing through the products of their choice. After the purchases, Users can visit the cart page before making the payment and can remove items if they wish so. Once, all the added items are verified in the cart, the users are redirected to the mock-up PayPal payment page. The payment gateway I implemented in this is a mock-up and would not require any credentials or card information to finalize the purchase. I have created a discount page for the membership user with credentials, username 'demouser' and password 'ThisIsForWPClass'. In this page, only the discount prices are shown. Only the membership user can access this membership page and the access is denied for other users.

		       <h2>Description of technology used for the site</h2>
		       <p> I hosted this website 'Web Programming E-commerce' on the FileZilla server. I have used technologies like php, html, css and Ajax to build this website.

		       <h2>What I have learned in this class</h2>
		       <p> Here are my few take aways from the class:
<ul>
<li> I have learned that Self learning can really take you a long way. The gist of what needs to be done and brief introduction to how the technology is used in real time given by the professor during class was a huge plus. These have really helped me to know the first basic traits to look into while learning any new technology or concept. </li>
<li> I have learned the importance of communication between fellow peers makes a huge difference. Exchange of ideas and knowledge, discussing a lot of things are always an added bonus. The knowledge I have on web programming have definitely been progressive compared to starting of the class. </li>
<li> The class have helped me become a more of a quick learner, as the assignments helped me in picking up on concepts that I had no knowledge on within a short span of time. </li>
<li> This class taught me the importance of time management and evaluating the quality of work that I do rather than running after the deadlines. The work I have done throughout the semester has been productive and progressive. </li>
<li> The skills I have learned in this class both technical and non-technical are going to help me wherever I go from now on. Although the technologies are continuously expanding and growing, I feel this course and skills I gained are a great foundation to start with and lead on. </li>
<li> My final takeaway would definitely be "To have fun and To choose powerfully".</li>
